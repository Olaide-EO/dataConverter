- ### Trees - Notes & Background
    - [ ] [Series: Trees (video)](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/data-structures/trees-95qda)
    - basic tree construction
    - traversal
    - manipulation algorithms
    - [ ] [BFS(breadth-first search) and DFS(depth-first search) (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWL6FJhq5fM)
        - BFS notes:
           - level order (BFS, using queue)
           - time complexity: O(n)
           - space complexity: best: O(1), worst: O(n/2)=O(n)
        - DFS notes:
            - time complexity: O(n)
            - space complexity:
                best: O(log n) - avg. height of tree
                worst: O(n)
            - inorder (DFS: left, self, right)
            - postorder (DFS: left, right, self)
            - preorder (DFS: self, left, right)
