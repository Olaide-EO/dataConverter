After going through this study plan, [I got hired\n> as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon](https://startupnextdoor.com/ive-been-acquired-by-amazon/?src=ciu)!\n> You probably won't have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.\n>\n> I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: [Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13)\n>\n> The items listed here will prepare you well for a technical interview at just about any software company,\n> including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.\n>\n> *Best of luck to you!*\n\n\n## What is it?\n\nThis is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to software engineer for a large company.\n\n![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://d3j2pkmjtin6ou.cloudfront.net/coding-at-the-whiteboard-silicon-valley.png)\n\nThis is meant for **new software engineers** or those switching from\nsoftware/web development to software engineering (where computer science knowledge is required). If you have\nmany years of experience and are claiming many years of software engineering experience, expect a harder interview.\n\nIf you have many years of software/web development experience, note that large software companies like Google, Amazon,\nFacebook and Microsoft view software engineering as different from software/web development, and they require computer science knowledge.\n\nIf you want to be a reliability engineer or operations engineer, study more from the optional list (networking, security).\n\n## Why use it?\n\nWhen I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to\ntraverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.\nEvery data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked\nunder the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an \"out of\nmemory\" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and\nthousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.\n\nIt's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\n\n## How to use it\n\n**Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.**\n\nOnce you are done with a section, you should mark it has completed by ticking the checkbox [ ].\n\n## Don't feel you aren't smart enough\n\n- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.\n- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)\n- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)\n\n## About Video Resources\n\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs.\nSometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.\n\n    I'd appreciate your help to add free and always-available public sources, such as YouTube videos to accompany the online course videos.\n    I like using university lectures.\n\n","filetype":".md","index":1},{"title":"Getting Started","category":null,"id":"getting_started","index":2},{"title":"Getting Started","category":"getting_started","id":"getting_started_getting_started","algorithm":"## Pick One Language for the Interview\n\nYou can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\n\n- C++\n- Java\n- Python\n\nYou could also use these, but read around first.

You Won't Remember it All\n\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going\nthrough my notes and making flashcards, so I could review.\n\nPlease, read so you won't make my mistakes:\n\n[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/).\n\nA course recommended to me (haven't taken it): [Learning how to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn).\n\n### 2. Use Flashcards\n\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.\nEach card has different formatting.\n\nI made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone and tablet, wherever I am.\n\nMake your own for free:\n\n- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards)\n- [My flash cards database (old - 1200 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db):\n- [My flash cards database (new - 1800 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db):\n\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It's way too much for what's required.\n\n**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don't mark it as known. You have to see the\nsame card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in\nyour brain.\n\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which has been recommended to me numerous times. It uses a repetition system to help you remember.\nIt's user-friendly, available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system. It costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\n\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks [@xiewenya](https://github.com/xiewenya)).\n\n### 3. Start doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structures and algorithms\n\nYou need to apply what you're learning to solving problems, or you'll forget. I made this mistake. Once you've learned a topic,\nand feel comfortable with it, like linked lists, open one of the coding interview books and do a couple of questions regarding\nlinked lists. Then move on to the next learning topic. Then later, go back and do another linked list problem,\nor recursion problem, or whatever. But keep doing problems while you're learning. You're not being hired for knowledge,\nbut how you apply the knowledge. There are several books and sites I recommend.\nSee here for more: [Coding Question Practice](#coding-question-practice).\n\n### 4. Review, review, review\n\nI keep a set of cheat sheets on ASCII, OSI stack, Big-O notations, and more. I study them when I have some spare time.\n\nTake a break from programming problems for a half hour and go through your flashcards.\n\n### 5. Focus\n\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music\nwithout lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well.\n\n## What you won't see covered\n\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\n\n- SQL\n- Javascript\n- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\n\n## The Daily Plan\n\nSome subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.\n\nEach day I take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:\n- C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args\n- C++ - without using built-in types\n- C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list\n- Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)\n- and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements\n- You may do Java or something else, this is just my thing\n\nYou don't need all these. You need only [one language for the interview](#pick-one-language-for-the-interview).\n\nWhy code in all of these?\n- Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)\n- Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python or Java))\n- Make use of built-in types, so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)\n\nI may not have time to do all of these for every subject, but I'll try.\n\nYou can see my code here:\n - [C](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)\n - [C++](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)\n - [Python](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)\n\nYou don't need to memorize the guts of every algorithm.\n\nWrite code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer.
