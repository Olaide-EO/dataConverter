## Coding exercises/challenges

Once you've learned your brains out, put those brains to work.
Take coding challenges every day, as many as you can.

- [Pramp: Mock interviews from/with peers](https://www.pramp.com/) - peer-to-peer model of practice interviews
- [Refdash: Mock interviews and expedited interviews](https://refdash.com/) - also help candidates fast track by skipping multiple interviews with tech companies
- [interviewing.io: Practice mock interview with senior engineers](https://interviewing.io) - anonymous algorithmic/systems design interviews with senior engineers from FAANG anonymously.
