- ### Dynamic Programming
    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.
