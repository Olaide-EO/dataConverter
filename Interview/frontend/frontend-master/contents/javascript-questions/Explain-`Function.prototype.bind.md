### Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.

Taken word-for-word from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind):

> The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

In my experience, it is most useful for binding the value of `this` in methods of classes that you want to pass into other functions. This is frequently done in React components.
