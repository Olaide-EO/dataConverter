### What does `* { box-sizing: border-box; }` do? What are its advantages?

- By default, elements have `box-sizing: content-box` applied, and only the content size is being accounted for.
- `box-sizing: border-box` changes how the `width` and `height` of elements are being calculated, `border` and `padding` are also being included in the calculation.
- The `height` of an element is now calculated by the content's `height` + vertical `padding` + vertical `border` width.
- The `width` of an element is now calculated by the content's `width` + horizontal `padding` + horizontal `border` width.
- Taking into account `padding`s and `border`s as part of our box model resonates better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.
